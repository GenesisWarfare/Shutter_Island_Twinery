I tested the interactive story several times by choosing different branches (director’s office, Ward C, the cave, the lighthouse) and everything worked smoothly. The world is well described, the atmosphere is vivid, and the tension grows naturally with every choice, making the experience highly immersive. The story adapts correctly to each path, and the transitions between passages are coherent and engaging. Choices are always clear, the environment feels alive with the storm, the cliffs, and the lighthouse, and the final twist triggers properly. I encountered no errors or broken links. The story is immersive, replayable, and faithful to the original mystery.

After checking out multiple routes including the main story line, I attest that it all worked perfectly, and each route was well thought out and fit the original story.
I experienced no problems playing using the html file and pressing links, and can confirm each path went smoothly.
I did not encounter errors.
